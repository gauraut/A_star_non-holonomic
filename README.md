2. In the terminal window, type,
```
python3 simulation.py
```
3. The program will ask user input on initial x, y coordinates and initial theta. It also asks the coordinates of the goal node and the two motor RPMs.
4. After the program is executed, the matplotlib output will be shown and the video will be saved.
